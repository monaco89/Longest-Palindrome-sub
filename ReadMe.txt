Longest palindrome subsequence.
A palindrome is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length 1, civic, racecar, and aibohphobia (fear of palindromes).
Give an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindrome that is a subsequence of a given input string. For example, given the input character, your algorithm should return carac. 
Implement your algorithm in C++ or Java using dynamic programming. Hand in necessary explanations to your program (recurrence or pseudo-code). What is the running time of your algorithm?
